A price comparing engine for Flipkart and Amazon

It uses the Flipkart developer API and Amazon product advertising API to get information of products related to a given search
string. It retrieves data from both marketplaces so that the users can choose the best deal.

I am still working on the watchlist for Flipkart, after which the users will be able to track each product.

A complete documentation will be provided shortly.
